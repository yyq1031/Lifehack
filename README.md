    const admin = require("firebase-admin");
    const serviceAccount = require("./firebase-server-account.json");

    if (!admin.apps.length) {
      admin.initializeApp({

Ensure that after git clone there is a public folder in client that contains a subfolder called models. Models should contain face_expression_model-shard1, face_expression_model-weights_manifest, tiny_face_detector_model-shard1, and tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest. These models can also be found at https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js-models.
